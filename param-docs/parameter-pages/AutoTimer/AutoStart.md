# Parameter `AutoStart`
Default Value: `enable`

!!! Warning
    This is an **Expert Parameter**! Only change it if you understand what it does!

Automatically start the Flow (Digitization Rounds) immediately after power up.

!!! Note
    Typically this is set to `enable`.
    The main reasons to set it to `disable` is when you want to trigger it manually using the
    [REST API](../REST-API) or [MQTT-API](../MQTT-API) or for debugging.
